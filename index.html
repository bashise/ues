            <h3>Seminars:</h3>
            <p>
Seminars organized bring together industry experts, professors, and professionals to share their expertise and insights. These seminars cover a wide range of topics, including emerging technologies, research advancements, and industry trends. The primary purpose of seminars is to expose students to the latest developments in the field of electrical engineering. Through these sessions, students gain valuable knowledge, learn about cutting-edge research, and understand the practical applications of electrical engineering concepts. Seminars also provide networking opportunities, allowing students to connect with professionals who can provide guidance, mentorship, and potential career opportunities. Moreover, seminars encourage critical thinking, inspire innovation, and broaden students' perspectives.

            <h3>Field Trips:</h3>
            <p>
Field trips organized provide students with valuable opportunities to explore real-world applications of electrical engineering concepts. These trips often involve visits to industrial facilities, research laboratories, or engineering projects. The main purpose of field trips is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge gained in classrooms and practical implementation in the industry. By witnessing engineering principles in action, students gain a deeper understanding of how their studies are applicable in the professional world. Field trips also allow students to network with professionals and gain insights into potential career paths. Additionally, these experiences foster teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities in a real-world context

            <h3>Outreaches:</h3>
            <p>
Outreaches organized focus on giving back to the community and creating a positive impact. These activities involve collaborating with local schools, community centers, or non-profit organizations to organize workshops, demonstrations, or educational programs related to electrical engineering. The main purpose of outreaches is to inspire and educate younger students about the field of electrical engineering. By engaging in hands-on activities and interactive sessions, the society members aim to generate interest and passion for STEM subjects among young minds. Outreaches also provide an opportunity for society members to develop leadership and communication skills while making a difference in the community. Moreover, these activities enhance the society's reputation, strengthen community ties, and promote the image of electrical engineering as a socially responsible profession.
